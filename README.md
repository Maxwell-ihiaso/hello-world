# hello-world
My journey started here
I am Maxwell Ihiaso. I Badged a Bachelors degree of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO). I love programming.
Today is 17th May, 2020. I started a professional course on "Python for data science" on coursera, on April 2020.
I am aimed at running a project - based learning, decide to join GitHub for this course, and will task myself to developping a model, even as I am learning. This will continue until I can stand proud of what I am becoming.
